# STM32F429ZI-Drivers

My design and development of drivers of STM32F429ZI MCU baed on ARM Cortex-M. The drivers are tested on STM32F429I-DISC1 evaluation kit.

The design and implementation are inspired from my absorbtion of knowledge gained form my coach: Mohamed Elzieny, Embedded Systems Design (ES2) course at Embedded Systems track in ITI Egypt and instructed by Master: Khaled Naga, STM32F4xx Standard Peripherlas Drivers, Jacob Beningo approach in his book " Reusable Firmware
Development A Practical Approach to APIs, HALs and Drivers " Apress 2017, Master: Ahmed Eldeeb, AUTOSAR sepecifications, and different sources during lifelong learning.

The drivers were developed using Attolic TrueStudio 9.3.0, ARM-GCC toolchain and tested on STM32F429I-DISC1 evaluation kit.
The drivers libraries is based on ARM CMSIS V3.20.

The library is continuously upadted.  
Current Release: 1.0.0  
Update Time: 18/01/2020
